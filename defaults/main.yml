# Set hibernate mode:
# hibernatemode = 0 (binary 0000) by default on supported desktops. The system will not back memory up to
#   persistent storage. The system must wake from the contents of memory; the system will lose context on
#   power loss. This is, historically, plain old sleep.
#
# hibernatemode = 3 (binary 0011) by default on supported portables. The system will store a copy of mem-ory memory
#   ory to persistent storage (the disk), and will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from
#   memory, unless a power loss forces it to restore from disk image.
#
# hibernatemode = 25 (binary 0001 1001) is only settable via pmset. The system will store a copy of mem-ory memory
#   ory to persistent storage (the disk), and will remove power to memory. The system will restore from
#   disk image. If you want "hibernation" - slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery life, you
#   should use this setting.

# Power Nap, available on Mac computers with flash memory, lets some Mac computers stay up to date
# even while they’re sleeping. When your Mac goes to sleep, Power Nap activates periodically to update information.
# The information that’s updated depends on whether your Mac is running on battery power (a Mac notebook computer)
# or plugged into a power adapter (a Mac notebook computer or Mac desktop computer).
# When your Mac is asleep and using battery power, Power Nap:
# * Checks for new messages in Mail
# * Updates events in Calendar
# * Updates other iCloud events
# When your Mac is plugged into a power adapter, Power Nap can also do activities such as
# downloading software updates and performing Time Machine backups.
